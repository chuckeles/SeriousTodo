An app for lazy Todoist users.

This is a board for my school project. The basic gist of it is that it will integrate with [Todoist](https://todoist.com) (and other todo apps later). Users will then be able to pledge real money to complete a particular task. Kind of like [Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com) but with the focus on todo apps and specific tasks.

## Scenarios

### Start

A user reads a blog post about Serious Todo or finds about it some other way. He wants to use it, so he visits the website and creates an account.

### Settings

The user then links his to-do app to Serious Todo account in order to use the app. He can also change his account settings, such as avatar and account information.

### Main

Every day (or regularly) the user logs into the Serious Todo app and lists his active to-do tasks, which are pulled and synched from the linked to-do apps. He can sort and filter (or search in) these tasks to better find the important tasks.

After that, the user wants to pledge his money on a specific task. This should give him more motivation to complete the task in a timely manner. He enters his PayPal information, which is saved so that the process is faster the next time. He enters an amount of money he wants to pledge. The PayPal account is charged right away.

All the tasks have to have a due date. If the user completes the task on time, he gets his money back. If not, the pledge is removed from the task and I keep the money. The user can then make a new pledge and set a new due date.
